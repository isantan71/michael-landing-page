## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- Yarn package manager

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variable:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
```

This password is used to authenticate users who want to access staging environment URLs. If not set, the default password is `admin123`.

### Development

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3013](http://localhost:3013)

The development server uses:
- Port: **3013**
- Host: **0.0.0.0** (accessible from network)
- Turbopack for faster builds

### Building for Production

Build the production bundle:

```bash
yarn build
```

Start the production server:

```bash
yarn start
```

The production server will run on port **3013**.

## Available Scripts

- `yarn dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `yarn build` - Build production bundle
- `yarn start` - Start production server
- `yarn lint` - Run TypeScript type checking and ESLint
- `yarn format` - Format code with Biome
